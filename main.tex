%% The abstract is a short summary of the work to be presented in the
%% article.
\begin{abstract}

Symbolic execution is a technique frequently used to reason about code. In symbolic execution, the analyser keeps track of a logical representation of state, and correctness verifications are SMT queries. Separation logic is frequently used to express and verify properties of programs with pointers or references. However, most SMT solvers (like the popular z3) do not support Separation Logic natively. CVC5 has introduced partial support for separation logic, which has not yet been integrated into a more high-level tools.

This work aims to address this gap, by providing a proof of concept for implementing the Frame Rule using SMT queries in the Symbolic Heap fragment of separation logic, supported by CVC5. We conclude that this encoding can simplify the machinery dealing with separation logic, such as that present in Viper, Smallfoot, and others.
